In 2025 I started keeping track of projects I was doing because I felt the need to log my progress. To share what I have learned, decided to build this site and publish my posts. One of my personal goals for 2026 is to build a product that has a positive impact and track my progress through blogging.

Currently I am working as a Data Science consultant, meaning I work on various projects of different durations and complexities. In most cases, the work you have delivered at a client, remains at the client. To be able to show my professional growth and keep an overview of my deliverables, I decided a blog would be the best format.

In addition to challenges I face at work, I also wanted to start my own personal projects to enable more creativity and broaden my knowledge on new topics, tools and languages. 

Are you interested in learning more about any of the topics I have written about, or just want to connect? Feel free to reach out: moc.kooltuo@gnaledccd.reverse()
