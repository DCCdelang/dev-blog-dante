I started building this site beginning of 2025 because I felt the need to log my progress. Working as consultant means working on various projects with different durations. In most cases, the work you have delivered at a client, remains at the client. To be able to show my professional growth and keep an overview of my deliverables, I decided a blog would be the best format.

This blog is not only meant to demonstrate work I have done for clients, but also share my other interesting topics or coding and data projects outside of work. In essence this site, together with my Github repositories can be considered as my portfolio that aims to reflect my interests.

Are you interested in learning more about any of the topics you encountered, feel free to reach out! I am always open for discussions.
