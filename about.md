I started building this site beginning of 2025 because I felt the need to log my progress. With this blog I want to share challenges, interesting topics and personal projects. 

Working as a consultant meant working on various projects with different durations. In most cases, the work you have delivered at a client, remains at the client. To be able to show my professional growth and keep an overview of my deliverables, I decided a blog would be the best format.

Are you interested in learning more about any of the topics I have written about? Feel free to reach out: [dccdelang@outlook.com](mailto:dccdelang@outlook.com)

## AI
The blog posts are written by me, *a human*, the site is build in collaboration with LLM's.
