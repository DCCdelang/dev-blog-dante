# Dante's Dev Blog

This repository contains the content for my personal blog site which can be found [here](https://dccdelang.github.io/dev-blog-dante/).

With this blog I aim to share my learnings with others and fuel my motivation for problem solving.

This site is based on Jekyll minima and is hosted by github pages.

Content will be added sporadically and consist of both technical topics and projects as other interests.

Hope u enjoy!
