Greetings visitor! Welcome to my blog, I have started this blog to discuss challenges I faced. To clear up my mind and improve the articulation of these challenges I have decided to (b)log the challenges I face and the solutions I think to have found. 

After following [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for some time and reading various super interesting blogposts I have decided to setup a blog site myself. It took some experimenting on what setup I would choose but I found, as with more things in life, the simpler the better. I ended up setting up Jekyll with Github pages. Low maintance, markdown based writing and easy post addition.
