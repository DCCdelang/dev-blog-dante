## Why did I set up a blog

Greetings visitor!

Rolling into the adulting work life I face decisions and difficulties that are in some part very common but sometimes unique and challenging. To clear up my mind and improve the articulation of these challenges I have decided to (b)log the challenges I face and the solutions I think to have found. 

After following [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for some time and reading various super interesting blogposts I have decided to setup a blog site myself. It took some experimenting on what setup I would choose but I found, as with more things in life, the simpler the better. I ended up setting up Jekyll with Github pages. Low maintance and easy post addition.
