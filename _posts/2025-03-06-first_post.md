One of things I enjoy the most, is explaining things, either complex or simple. I enjoy seeing someone putting the pieces together and understanding something. Something that was first difficult, confusing or complex, becomes clear and logical.

Besides teaching I really love to build, this is also one of the reason I became fond of coding. You have various possible building blocks that you can bring together, creating something new and unique. When coding I always try to remember that anything can be done, and that is rather a question of resources and time, always stuck with me. While coding can sometimes remain to be vague and obscure. I enjoy similar satisfaction when I am building or repairing something in the house or when I am practicing sculpting or painting.

After following [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for some time and reading various interesting blogposts, I have decided to setup a blog site myself. It took some experimenting on what setup I would choose but I found, as with more things in life, the simpler the better. I ended up setting up Jekyll with Github pages. Low maintance, markdown based writing making it easy to create posts.
