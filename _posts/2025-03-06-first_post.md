Greetings visitor! Welcome to my blog, I have started this blog to keep track of interesting topics I have come accross and would like to share.

After following [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for some time and reading various super interesting blogposts I have decided to setup a blog site myself. It took some experimenting on what setup I would choose but I found, as with more things in life, the simpler the better. I ended up setting up Jekyll with Github pages. Low maintance, markdown based writing and easy post addition.
