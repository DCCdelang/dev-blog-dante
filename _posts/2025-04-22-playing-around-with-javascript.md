For this post I wanted to see what kind of interactions are possible using Javascript within the static environment of jekyll and github pages. 

For instance a [soundboard](https://dccdelang.github.io/dev-blog-dante/soundboard/)!

For instance a [artscript](https://dccdelang.github.io/dev-blog-dante/artscript/)!  <!--(http://127.0.0.1:4000/artscript/)! -->
